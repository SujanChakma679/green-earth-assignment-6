1. **Var, Let, Const**
   - **Var:** Function-scoped, can be changed and redeclared, old-style.
   - **Let:** Block-scoped, can be changed but cannot be redeclared in the same block.
   - **Const:** Block-scoped, cannot be changed or redeclared, but objects/arrays inside can be modified.

2. **forEach(), map(), filter()**
   - **forEach():** A method that runs a function on each item of an array. It does not return anything.
   - **map():** A method that creates a new array by transforming each item of the original array.
   - **filter():** A method that creates a new array with only the items that pass a test.

3. **Arrow Functions**
   - A short and simple way to write functions in JavaScript using `=>`.

4. **Destructuring Assignment**
   - A way to extract values from arrays or objects into separate variables easily.

5. **Template Literals**
   - Use backticks `` ` ``, let us embed variables easily with `${}`, and allow multi-line strings, unlike traditional string concatenation.
